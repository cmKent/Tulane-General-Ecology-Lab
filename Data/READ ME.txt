This folder contains the data for the lab excercises. 

IMPORTANT!!! If you wish to update the data be sure to check the following
	1) Your new .csv file is formated the same as the old one
		a) It has identical column names (remember it is case sensetive)
		b) It does not contain any new columns or is missing past columns
		c) Data within each column is formated the same way with the same level names. For example:
			i) If you are updating the spider lab, the spider names must be spelled/formatted the same way as in the orriginal version
			ii) Likewise for this lab proximity to substrate should be abbreviated c,m,f. Note it is CASE SENSETIVE
	2) Your new .csv must by titled the same as the old one (remember it is case sensetive)
	3) IMMEADIETLY after replacing the file, re-run the _Completed.R files to make sure they still work
	4) You will need to render the R markdown files again to keep them consistent with the data
